    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to LazyTapGame’s website and services, where you can find policies and terms governing your use of products and services
      provided by LazyTapGame and its affiliates (collectively, the “<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” and “<strong>our</strong>”).
    </p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“<strong>ToS</strong>” or “<strong>Terms</strong>”) constitute a legal agreement between the user of our products and services (“<strong>user</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”)
      and the Company. These Terms apply when a user accesses, uses, or visits our website (if any) (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), the associated mobile application(s) available
      for download in Google Play, the Apple App Store, and/or other third-party app stores or pre-installed on third-party devices (the “<strong>App</strong>”),
      and/or services provided through the Site and the App. In these ToS, the term “<strong>Service</strong>” means and includes the Site, the App, and these services,
      individually or collectively.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      We prepared these ToS to help explain the terms that apply to your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p style="margin:0">
        By visiting the Site, downloading the App, or otherwise using the Service, you indicate your agreement to be bound by these ToS.
        If you do not agree with these ToS, you must not use the Service and uninstall the App if you have already downloaded it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Privacy Policy is part of and is governed by these ToS. By agreeing to these ToS, you agree to be bound by the terms of the Privacy Policy and
      agree that we may use information collected from you in accordance with its terms.

    <h2>Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This section is a template-style notice. If you do not want arbitration language, you can remove this section and keep “Governing Law & Courts” below.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
      <p style="margin:0">
        These ToS contain provisions that govern how claims you and we may have against each other are resolved.
        Subject to limited exceptions and where permitted by applicable law, disputes may be resolved on an individual basis and not as part of any class or representative action.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Updates to these ToS</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify these ToS from time to time. We will notify you of material changes in accordance with applicable laws.
      If you do not agree with the proposed changes, you should discontinue your use of the Service and uninstall the App.
      If you continue using the Service after the new terms take effect, you will be bound by the modified ToS.
    </p>

    <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>
      The Company will not be responsible for any failure to perform its obligations under these ToS due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control including,
      without limitation, acts of God, war, riot, terrorism, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, flood, or accidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Independent Contractors</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing in these ToS shall be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, or franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between us and any user.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Party Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may use third-party service providers to operate and improve the Service and/or to show advertisements to you to help support and maintain the Service.
